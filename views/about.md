I am a programmer that loves food, play games <a href="http://blog.counter-strike.net/" target="_blank">csgo</a> (ftw), and travel. So you will see a mixture of tech, travel, food and stuff. You might see more post related to technology, but I won't limit myself to that, thats where the stuff part comes in.

So feel free to leave comments and/or contact me about content you are interested in.
